# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 14, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a simple calculator app.

**Thoughts**: ~~It's working fine for two elements' operations, but needs some fixes on operators precedence (multiplication and division).~~ Thanks to [this example](https://gist.github.com/mwoods79/4213166), everything is working (I guess).

I reused the design that [I did some months ago](http://codepen.io/hezag/pen/Ywbxjg).
