# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 13, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a simple calculator app.

**Thoughts**: It's working fine for two elements' operations, but needs some fixes on operators precedence (multiplication and division).
I reused the design that [I did some months ago.](http://codepen.io/hezag/pen/Ywbxjg).
